# CC3200_dAISy
  This Energia sketch sets up dAISy and the Texas Instruments CC3200 LaunchPad for use as a low cost shore based AIS station that reports data to MarineTraffic.  
  
  Created by Frank Milburn, December 2015
  
  Tested on a CC3200 LaunchPad and Energia v17 (non EMT) with a dAISy BoosterPack on a MSP-EXP430F5529 LaunchPad.  The sketch should also work with an enclosed dAISy if the CC3200 is connected to the pins on the PCB.
